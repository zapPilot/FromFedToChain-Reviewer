  "title": "When Coinbase Wants to Issue Its Own Token: How Did BASE Tokens Transform from \"Toll Collectors\" to \"Money Printing Machines\"? A Paradigm Shift in Layer 2 Cryptocurrency Economics",
  "content": "Achim Struve of Outlier Ventures recently published a groundbreaking proposal: designing a revolutionary token economy model for Coinbase's Base Layer 2. This isn't just another \"governance token\" story, but a thought experiment on how to redefine Layer 2 value capture.\n\nMore importantly, this proposal reveals a profound insight overlooked by most: **the biggest problem with Layer 2 isn't technology, but the business model.**\n\n## The Revenue Dilemma of Layer 2 Through the Lens of a \"Restaurant Business\"\n\nLet me first use a simple analogy to explain the fundamental contradiction facing Layer 2.\n\nImagine you own a restaurant. You have two ways to make money:\n\n**Method A: Charge high seating fees**\n\n- $100 per customer upon entry\n\n- High revenue, but few customers\n\n- The restaurant is always half empty\n\n**Method B: Free seating, charge only for food**\n\n- A constant stream of customers\n\n- Intense competition for food, resulting in meager profits\n\n- The restaurant is full, but you're not making money\n\nThis is the \"Revenue-Growth Paradox\" faced by Layer 2:\n\n- High gas fees = high revenue but customer churn\n\n- Low gas fees = customer growth but meager revenue\n\nAs the proposal points out, Base has:\n\n- $4.95 billion in TVL (Total Value Locked)\n\n- 1 million daily active users\n\nBut monthly transaction fees are only $5.1 million\n\nWhy? Because Base's average transaction fee is only $0.02—a necessary price to pay for competitiveness.\n\n## The Painful Lessons of ARB, OP, and MATIC: Why Have Traditional Layer 2 Tokens Failed?\n\nBefore discussing BASE's innovations, we must understand why existing Layer 2 tokens have performed so poorly.\n\nArbitrum (ARB), Optimism (OP), and Polygon (MATIC)—these are all successful Layer 2 networks, yet their token performance lags far behind Ethereum. Why?\n\n**Fatal flaws of traditional Layer 2 tokens:**\n\n1. **Single revenue source:** Relies solely on transaction fee sharing.\n\n2. **Intense fee competition:** Fees must be low to attract users.\n\n3. **Token unlocking pressure:** Large-scale token unlocking creates selling pressure.\n\n4. **Lack of real demand:** Holding tokens only grants \"governance rights,\" not actual returns.\n\nThis is like issuing a \"restaurant membership card\" that only allows you to participate in voting on the restaurant's decor color, offering no real benefit. Who would want it?\n\nThe proposal's author astutely observes:\n\n\"The crypto community has long misjudged the value accumulation narrative of L1 assets, believing the primary driver is transaction fees. The value of ETH and SOL primarily derives from being locked in AMM pools as quotation currency, not from gas fees.\"\n\n[AMM] Automated Market Maker, the core mechanism of decentralized exchanges.\n\n[Quote Currency] Refers to the currency used as the pricing benchmark in a trading pair, such as USDC in ETH/USDC.\n\nThis statement sounds technical, but it actually reveals a counterintuitive truth: **Ethereum's value doesn't come from the gas fees you pay, but from its role as the \"base currency\" in DeFi.**\n\n## The Revolutionary Design of the BASE Token: From \"Toll Fees\" to \"Infrastructure\"\n\nNow let's look at the core innovation of the BASE proposal. It's not trying to take a cut of transaction fees, but rather to **change the rules of the game itself**.\n\n### Innovation 1: Quotation Currency Mechanism\n\nImagine what would happen if all decentralized exchanges on Base had to use BASE as their trading pair?\n\n**Traditional Model:**\n\n- Users trade TOKEN/ETH or TOKEN/USDC on Uniswap\n\n- BASE is just one of many tokens, without any special status.\n\n**BASE Model:**\n\n- Users trade TOKEN/BASE on DEXs on Base\n\n- BASE becomes the standard pair currency for all liquidity pools\n\n- To provide liquidity, you **must** hold BASE.\n\nThis creates a fundamental source of demand: not because of speculation, but because of the **structural need to provide liquidity**.\n\nJust as the US dollar became the settlement currency for international trade, BASE attempts to become the \"reserve currency\" of the Base ecosystem. ### Innovation 2: veBASE Voting Custody Mechanism\n\nThis mechanism borrows from Curve Finance [a decentralized stablecoin exchange known for its veCRV voting custody model]:\n\n**Operation Flow:**\n\n1. **Lock BASE** → Obtain veBASE [vote-escrowed BASE]\n\n2. **veBASE Voting Rights** → Determine which liquidity pools receive rewards\n\n3. **Protocol Competition** → Projects accumulate veBASE to drive liquidity to their own pools\n\n4. **Bribery Market** → Projects directly pay veBASE holders to obtain votes\n\nThis creates the so-called \"Curve...\" \"Wars\" [2021-2022 DeFi Projects' Competition for Curve Governance] Updates:\n\n- The protocol requires BASE liquidity to function.\n\n- To gain liquidity, veBASE voting power needs to be accumulated.\n\n- This reduces the circulating supply of BASE.\n\n- Simultaneously creates continuous buying pressure.\n\n### Innovation 3: Adaptive Emission System\n\nThis is the boldest and most controversial part of the proposal. Traditional tokens have fixed release plans, but BASE proposes a **dynamic adjustment** mechanism:\n\n**During periods of economic prosperity (strong KPI performance):**\n\n- Increase token distribution to the community and users\n\n- Reward ecosystem participants\n\n**During periods of economic recession (weak KPI performance):**\n\n- Increase incentives for builders and validators\n\n- Stimulate investment in development and cybersecurity\n\nThis is similar to a central bank's counter-cyclical policy: tightening during booms and loosening during recessions. But this time, it's executed automatically through machine learning algorithms.\n\n## Historical Analogy: Business Model Innovation in Risk Management as Seen Through Lloyd's Insurance Company\n\nTo truly understand the deep logic of the BASE proposal, we need to return to 17th-century London.\n\nMaritime trade at that time was fraught with risk: shipwrecks, cargo theft, and severe weather. Merchants' first reaction was to **improve ship design and enhance navigation technology**—a typical \"technical solution\" mindset.\n\nBut the real breakthrough came from the innovation of Lloyd's Café [later becoming Lloyd's of London, the birthplace of modern insurance]: not eliminating risk, but **managing and diversifying risk**.\n\nInsurers don't need to make the ocean safe; they only need to:\n\n1. Collect enough premiums\n\n2. Diversify the risk across multiple insurers\n\n3. Use statistics to predict losses\n\nThe logic of BASE is very similar: instead of perfecting Layer 2 gas costs (technical solution), it's about **redesigning the value capture mechanism** (business model solution).\n\nThe key differences are:\n\n- **Technical Solution**: Attempts to eliminate problems (faster TPS, lower costs)\n\n- **Business Model Solution**: Attempts to manage problems (makes costs predictable, makes value capture sustainable)\n\n## In-depth Mechanism Analysis: How Does BASE Create a Value Flywheel?\n\nLet's trace the complete value cycle of the BASE token:\n\n**First Layer: Basic Demand**\n\n- DEXs on Base use BASE as the quote currency\n\n- Liquidity providers need to hold BASE to provide liquidity\n\n- This creates structured buying demand\n\n**Second Layer: Governance Competition**\n\n- Project teams wanting liquidity incentives\n\n- must accumulate veBASE voting rights\n\n- Locking in BASE reduces circulating supply.\n\n**Third Layer: Bribery Market**\n\n- The project team directly pays fees to veBASE holders.\n\n- veBASE holders receive double benefits (basic rewards + bribes).\n\n- More people are willing to lock in BASE.\n\n**Fourth Layer: Protocol-Owned Liquidity**\n\n- Base uses sequencer revenue (fees earned from processing transactions in Layer 2) to purchase BASE.\n\n- Establishes the protocol's own liquidity pool.\n\n- Earns continuous revenue from transaction fees.\n\nThis flywheel, once started, can theoretically be self-reinforcing. But the key word is \"theoretically.\"\n\n## Counterintuitive Insight: Why This \"Perfect Design\" Might Be Doomed to Fail?\n\nMost people, upon seeing a BASE proposal, think, \"Wow, this design is brilliant!\" But as we learn from history, **the most brilliant designs are often the most fragile.**\n\nLet me share a few counterintuitive insights:\n\n### Insight 1: Complexity is the Biggest Enemy\n\nConceptual Levels Users Must Understand:\n\n1. AMM Mechanism (How to Provide Liquidity)\n\n2. veToken Governance (Lock-up Period, Voting Power Decay)\n\n3. Adaptive Emissions (How the Algorithm Adjusts Rewards)\n\n4. Bidding Currency Logic (Why BASE/TOKEN is Superior to ETH/TOKEN)\n\n5. Bribery Markets (How to Optimize Voting Rewards)\n\nEach additional layer of complexity will result in a 30-50% loss of potential users. After five layers, ultimately only about **3% of users** will be able to fully understand and participate in the system.\n\nThis is like designing a game that requires a PhD to play—no matter how sophisticated, it's destined for a niche audience.\n\n### Insight Two: Coinbase's Conflict of Interest\n\nThe proposal assumes Coinbase will fully support BASE, but reality is more complex:\n\n**Coinbase's Trilemma:**\n\n- **Option A:** Maximize the value of the BASE token (requires subsidizing the BASE trading pair and sharing sequencer revenue)\n\n- **Option B:** Maximize sequencer profits (requires maintaining high fees and retaining all revenue)\n\n- **Option C:** Maximize the COIN share price (requires quarterly profits and cannot conduct long-term experiments)\n\nAs a publicly traded company, Coinbase's fiduciary responsibility lies with **COIN shareholders**, not BASE holders. This creates a structural conflict.\n\nHistorical evidence: Facebook's Libra/Diem project serves as a lesson—when regulatory pressure mounts, publicly traded companies don't hesitate to abandon crypto experiments to protect their core business.\n\n### Insight 3: The Psychological Barrier to Pricing Currency\n\nThe proposal assumes users will use BASE as their pricing currency, but ignores a deep psychological fact: **humans need a stable unit of account.**\n\nThink about your own investment portfolio. What do you likely use to calculate profits and losses?\n\n- US Dollar (stable, familiar)\n\n- Or ETH (if you're a crypto native)\n\nBut would you use a volatile Layer 2 token for accounting? This requires overcoming decades of ingrained psychological habits.\n\nEven on Ethereum, most transactions still use USDC/USDT (stablecoin) instead of ETH as the quote currency, despite ETH being the \"native asset.\" This illustrates that **stability trumps nativeness**.\n\n### Insight 4: Regulatory Risks Are Severely Underestimated\n\nThe BASE token meets all four elements of the Howey Test under US securities law [the four-factor test for determining whether an asset is a security]:\n\n1. ✓ Financial Investment: Users purchase/lock BASE tokens\n\n2. ✓ Shared Enterprise: Aggregated in an AMM liquidity pool, sharing governance\n\n3. ✓ Profit Expectations: veBASE returns, token appreciation, bribe income\n\n4. ✓ External Efforts: Coinbase (sequencer), protocol (pool management), voters (emission decisions)\n\nThis means the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) is very likely to classify BASE as a **securities**.\n\nWorse still, Coinbase's \"compliant status\" actually increases the risks:\n\n- Anonymity protocols (like Curve) are difficult to enforce.\n\n- Coinbase is a US company, and its executives can be prosecuted.\n\n- Coinbase has already been sued by the SEC for its staking service.\n\n- Launching BASE is like rubbing salt into an existing wound.\n\n## Real-world Risk Scenarios: When Ideal Meets Reality\n\nLet's honestly assess a few possible scenarios:\n\n### Scenario 1: Governance Capture (60-70% probability)\n\nThe lesson of Curve Wars: Convex Finance accumulated most of the veCRV within 12 months, effectively controlling the entire system.\n\nIn the BASE scenario:\n\n1. Early whales accumulate a large amount of veBASE.\n\n2. Voting directs all rewards to their own liquidity pool.\n\n3. Small holders realize the game is being manipulated and choose to exit.\n\n4. Centralization intensifies in a reflexive cycle.\n\n5. Decentralization goals are completely failed.\n\n### Scenario Two: Liquidity Fragmentation (40-50% probability)\n\nAfter the launch of the BASE trading pair:\n\n- Initially, rewards attract yield farmers, capturing 15-20% of trading volume.\n\n- However, fragmented liquidity leads to lower execution efficiency compared to the ETH trading pair.\n\n- Real users avoid the BASE trading pair (choosing optimal execution rather than subsidies).\n\n- The protocol stops incentivizing the BASE trading pair (complexity not worthwhile).\n\n- Death Spiral: Less Liquidity → Worse Execution → Less Use → Less Liquidity\n\n**Key Metric:** If the execution efficiency of the BASE trading pair is **more than 5%** worse than that of the ETH trading pair, the game is over. Users choose optimal execution, not subsidies.\n\n### Scenario 3: Bear Market Death Spiral (50%+ Probability)\n\nDuring a long-term bear market (2026-2027?):\n\n1. BASE price plummets by 70-90% (typical performance of Layer 2 tokens)\n\n2. Locked veBASE holders suffer unrealized losses.\n\n3. Unlocking events trigger cascading sell-offs (heading towards the exit).\n\n4. Positive feedback loop: Sell → Price drop → More selling.\n\n5. Governance collapses, voters lose confidence.\n\nTerra/Olympus's lesson: Reflexive tokens collapse **faster** in bear markets because the mechanism itself amplifies the decline.\n\n### Scenario 4: Regulatory Shutdown (Probability 30-40%)\n\nWithin 6-18 months, the SEC will:\n\n1. Issue a Wells Notice (a warning notice before formal enforcement) or file a lawsuit.\n\n2. Coinbase is forced to stop BASE development/distribution.\n\n3. veBASE holders' tokens become worthless or permanently locked.\n\n4. Token holders file a class-action lawsuit.\n\n5. Coinbase's reputation is damaged, and COIN's stock price falls.\n\n**Timeline:** 6-18 months after release (if not blocked before release)\n\n## Smarter Alternative: Pure Fixed Sequencer Fee Sharing Model\n\nAfter in-depth analysis, there is a simpler and lower-risk alternative:\n\n**Core Design:**\n\n1. **Token Name:** BASE (or BSX)\n\n2. **Single Functionality:** Staking tokens → Earning a share of sequencer fees (paid in ETH)\n\n3. **Zero Governance:** Tokens have no protocol governance rights\n\n4. **No Forced Pairing:** Tokens trade like any asset, not forced to be a quote currency\n\n**Why This is Superior:**\n\n**Simplicity:**\n\n- Single use case: \"Claim of Base L2 revenue\"\n\n- No complex veToken, metric voting, or bribery markets\n\n- Easy to audit, minimal attack surface\n\n**Regulation:**\n\n- Still potentially a security (Howey Test: profiting from others' efforts)\n\n- **But:** A much simpler structure makes the compliance path clearer\n\n- Removed the \"active governance\" layer of adaptive emissions\n\n- Potential SEC registration, restrictions on accredited investors, or use of regulated platforms\n\n**Incentive Alignment:**\n\n- Direct value proposition: \"If Base succeeds → more fees → token appreciation\"\n\n- No complex emissions or governance games\n\n- Users benefit from network growth without needing to understand veToken economics\n\n**Avoid Market Failure:**\n\n- No quote currency coordination issues\n\n- Compatible with existing ETH/USDC standards\n\n- No liquidity fragmentation\n\n- Adapts to user behavior, not against it\n\n**Comparison:**\n\n| Dimensions | veBASE Quote Currency | Fee Sharing Token |\n\n|------|----------------|-------------|\n\n| Complexity | Extremely High (5+ layers) | Low (Single Function) | | Regulatory Risks | Extreme (Proactive Management + Revenue) | High but Manageable (Simple Revenue) |\n\n| User Adoption | Requires Behavioral Change | Does Not Require Behavioral Change |\n\n| Technical Risks | High (Complex Contracts) | Low (Proven Patterns) |\n\n| Value Capture | Indirect (Adoption via Quoted Currency) | Direct (Adoption via Sequencer Fees) |\n\n| Success Probability | <20% | ~40-50% |\n\n## Practical Implications for Ordinary Investors\n\nIf you are an investor interested in the Base ecosystem, how should you consider this proposal?\n\n**Optimistic Scenario (Probability <20%):**\n\n- BASE successfully becomes the primary quoted currency on Base\n\n- veBASE governance maintains decentralization and functionality\n\n- Coinbase's full support, even at the cost of short-term profits\n\n- Unexpectedly relaxed regulatory environment\n\nLaunch coincided with a bull market, leading to rapid user adoption\n\n**If all of these happen:** BASE could become an extremely valuable asset, similar to early CRV or CVX.\n\n**Real-world Scenario (30% probability):**\n\n- BASE launched but remains a secondary option for ETH/USDC\n\n- Small, focused veBASE community\n\n- Never achieved quote currency dominance\n\n- Became \"another least useful governance token\"\n\n**Failure Scenario (50%+ probability):**\n\n- Regulatory shutdown, or\n\n- Governance capture, or\n\n- Liquidity fragmentation, or\n\n- Bear market death spiral, or\n\n- A combination of the above\n\n## Conclusion: The Gap Between Elegant Theory and Ugly Reality\n\nThe BASE token proposal represents one of the most sophisticated thought experiments in Layer 2 token economics. It identified the real problem (the limitations of fee capture) and offered an innovative solution (the quote currency model).\n\nBut as we learn time and again from history, **the most ingenious designs often crumble when faced with the real world.**\n\nThe fatal flaw in this proposal isn't technical, but rather its assumptions:\n\n- It assumes users will change deep-seated psychological habits (preferential unit of account)\n\n- It assumes governance will resist capture (historical evidence contradicts this)\n\n- It assumes Coinbase will sacrifice short-term profits (corporate fiduciary responsibility says no)\n\n- It assumes regulatory leniency (SEC actions say no)\n\n- It assumes complexity is acceptable (user behavior says no)\n\nEach assumption is plausible individually, but **the probability of all assumptions holding true simultaneously is extremely low.**\n\nThis is why I believe that while the BASE proposal is intellectually exciting, it could be a disaster in practice. It attempts to address the optimization problem by introducing existential risks (monitoring, coordination, behavior) (a slightly better L2 value capture).\n\nA **smarter approach** is simplification: a pure sequencer cost-sharing model provides 80% of the value but only 20% of the risk. It works with user behavior, not against it. It's simple enough to explain and powerful enough to capture value.\n\nRegardless of the final design adopted by BASE, this proposal has spurred an important dialogue: How can Layer 2 capture value without sacrificing its core value proposition (low cost)? The answer to this question will shape the future of the entire Layer 2 ecosystem.\n\nPerhaps the most important lesson isn't about token design, but about innovation itself: **Sometimes, the best solution isn't the smartest, but the simplest.** In a world full of uncertainty, resilience trumps elegance, and simplicity trumps sophistication.\n\nThe BASE proposal is a beautiful theory. But as Mike Tyson said, \"Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face.\" When BASE encounters the \"punches\" of regulation, the market, and human nature, we see the fragility of theory and the power of simplicity.",
