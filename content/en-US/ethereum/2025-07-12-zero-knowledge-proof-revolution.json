  "title": "Zero-knowledge proof: When \"secret\" becomes the most powerful evidence",
  "content": "Have you ever thought about how you can prove that you know a secret in the digital world without revealing it? It sounds like magic, but this is the miracle that Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are achieving. It is not only a breakthrough in cryptography, but also the key to privacy and efficiency in our digital lives. Recently, the Ethereum Foundation announced an ambitious technical strategy: they want to make 99% of the blocks complete proof within 10 seconds, keep the hardware cost below $100,000, and the energy consumption no more than 10 kilowatts. At the same time, Vitalik Buterin is also thinking about how to use zero-knowledge proofs to solve the fundamental problem of digital identity. What kind of revolutionary significance is hidden behind these seemingly technical breakthroughs?   The logic behind the magic: What exactly is zero-knowledge proof? Let me explain with a simple example. Imagine you have a color-blind friend, and you have two balls in your hand, one red and one green. You want to prove to your friend that the colors of the two balls are indeed different, but you don't want to tell him which one is red and which one is green. You can do this: 1. Let your friend look at the two balls, and then you hide the balls behind your back 2. Your friend randomly decides whether to swap the positions of the two balls 3. You take the balls out again, and your friend asks you: \"Did I swap them?\" 4. You can accurately answer \"yes\" or \"no\" If the two balls are the same color, you can only guess, with an accuracy rate of only 50%. But if the colors are different, you can always give the correct answer. After repeating this process many times, your friend will be sure that the two balls are different colors, but still don't know which color is which. This is the essence of zero-knowledge proof: proving a fact (the balls are different colors) without revealing any additional information (the specific color).   Ethereum's new ambition: making blockchain as fast as the speed of light Now let's put this concept into the world of blockchain. Ethereum faces a huge challenge: every transaction needs to be verified by all nodes, just like a busy bank, every transfer must be rechecked by all tellers. This leads to network congestion and high fees. Zero-knowledge proof provides an elegant solution: zkEVM (zero-knowledge Ethereum virtual machine). Imagine now that this bank hired a super-efficient internal auditor. This auditor could process thousands of transactions and then generate a very concise report: \"All 10,000 transactions I processed were valid.\" The bank's main system only needs to verify this one report, rather than rechecking every transaction. This is how zkEVM works. It processes a large number of transactions \"off-chain\" and then submits a compact zero-knowledge proof to the Ethereum mainnet that all of these transactions are valid. The technical indicators set by the Ethereum Foundation show the maturity of this technology: -  99% of the blocks are proven within 10 seconds : This means almost instant transaction confirmation -  Hardware cost is less than $100,000 : Allow more validators to participate -  Energy consumption is no more than 10 kilowatts : Approximately equivalent to the power consumption of several high-performance computers These numbers may seem technical, but they represent a turning point: zero-knowledge proof has moved from the laboratory to practical use.   New possibilities for digital identity: You are you, but no one knows who you are The application of zero-knowledge proof is far more than improving blockchain efficiency. Vitalik's recent thinking reveals another important direction: digital identity system. Traditional identity verification is like showing your ID card to a nightclub. The security guard needs to confirm that you are over 18 years old, but he will also see a lot of unnecessary information such as your name, address, birthday, photo, etc. Zero-knowledge proof can make this process more private: you can show a digital certificate that only shows \"this person is over 18 years old\", and the security system will show \"pass\" or \"reject\", but will not reveal any other information about you. This technology is particularly important for solving the challenge of \"one person, one identity\". In the digital age, how to ensure that everyone can only receive one government subsidy, can only vote once, and can only participate in one airdrop, while protecting personal privacy? Zero-knowledge proof provides the answer. You can prove that you are a unique individual without revealing your true identity. It's like being at a masquerade where everyone is wearing a mask, but the system ensures that no one enters twice.   Privacy Revolution: From \"Data Minimization\" to \"Knowledge Minimization\" Zero-knowledge proofs represent a fundamental shift in thinking about privacy protection. In the past, we talked about \"data minimization\": collecting as little personal data as possible. But zero-knowledge proofs achieve \"knowledge minimization\": even in the case where data must be shared, only the minimum knowledge is revealed. This distinction is very important. In a data minimization world, you still need to trust the data collector to handle your information responsibly. But in a knowledge minimization world, even if the data collector wants to abuse your information, they don't have enough information to abuse. For example, suppose you want to participate in a DeFi protocol and need to prove that your assets exceed a certain threshold. In the traditional way, you may need to connect your wallet to let the protocol see all your assets. But with zero-knowledge proof, you only need to generate a proof \"my assets exceed X\", and the protocol verifies this proof, without knowing your specific assets or your wallet address.   Technical Challenge: There is no free lunch Of course, zero-knowledge proof is not a panacea. It faces several important challenges:  Computational complexity : Generating zero-knowledge proofs requires a lot of computing resources. Although verifying the proof is fast, generating the proof may take several minutes or even longer. This is why the Ethereum Foundation’s 10-second goal is so important — it represents a major advance in the technology.  Difficulty of development : Designing zero-knowledge proof circuits requires highly specialized cryptography knowledge. It’s like requiring every web developer to understand quantum mechanics. The good news is that development tools are improving rapidly.  Trusted setup : Some zero-knowledge proof schemes (such as zk-SNARKs) require a “trusted setup”. If the setup process is compromised, the security of the entire system is threatened. It’s like when building a house, if there is a problem with the foundation, the whole building may collapse.  Quantum threat : Most current zero-knowledge proof schemes are not quantum-resistant. Although the threat of quantum computers is still far away, it is an issue that needs to be considered in advance.   Future vision: a more private and efficient digital world Despite the challenges, zero-knowledge proofs are reshaping our digital future. In the financial field, you can conduct completely private transactions while still meeting regulatory requirements. You can prove to regulators that your transactions are legal, but you don’t need to disclose the counterparty or the specific amount. In social networks, you can prove that you are a real user, not a robot, but the platform will not know your real identity or other social media accounts. In voting systems, each vote is counted correctly, but no one can trace a specific vote back to a specific person. In education and employment, you can prove that you have a certain skill or degree without revealing your complete academic record or personal information.   Why is this revolution worth paying attention to? Zero-knowledge proof is not only a technological innovation, it represents an important turning point in digital society. In the Web2 era, we are accustomed to the binary choice of \"either all public or full trust\". Either you give all your information to the platform, or you can't use the service at all. Zero-knowledge proof provides a third option: \"selective transparency\". You can precisely control what information to reveal, when to reveal it, and to whom to reveal it. This fine control is back in the hands of individuals. It's like going from \"either the door is open or locked\" to \"you can selectively open a crack to let certain people see certain things.\" When the Ethereum Foundation talks about 10 seconds of proof time and $100,000 in hardware costs, they are actually talking about making the technology cheap and fast enough for everyone to use. When Vitalik thinks about digital identity, he is exploring how to allow everyone to remain private and participate in society in the digital world. The core of this revolution is not the technology itself, but the redefinition of the boundaries of trust, privacy, and verification. In the near future, \"prove without leaking\" may become a basic principle of digital interaction, just as \"encrypted transmission\" has become a standard for network communication today. Zero-knowledge proof teaches us an important lesson: in the digital world, the strongest evidence is often the secrets you don’t need to show. When technology enables us to “prove and keep secrets”, we are truly close to the ideal state of the digital world: transparent and private, verifiable and secure.",
