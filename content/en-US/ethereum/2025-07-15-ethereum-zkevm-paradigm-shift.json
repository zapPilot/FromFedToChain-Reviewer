  "title": "Ethereum’s Cryptography Revolution: A Paradigm Shift from “Re-Execution” to “Proof-of-Verification”",
  "content": "Have you ever wondered why Ethereum is going to undergo a more revolutionary technical upgrade than \"The Merge\"? In 2025, Ethereum is preparing for a change that goes further than the shift from proof of work to proof of stake: upgrading the entire Layer 1 to a zero-knowledge proof system. This is not just a technical optimization, but a fundamental redefinition of how blockchain works. A paradigm shift from \"re-execution\" to \"proof verification\" Let me explain this huge shift with a simple metaphor. Imagine you have a famous recipe book (the Ethereum blockchain). Every time someone wants to cook a dish (execute a transaction), the current practice is that everyone in the kitchen (each node) must cook the entire dish themselves, following every step of the recipe to ensure that the final result is the same. This ensures accuracy, but is very slow, expensive, and limits how many dishes can be cooked at once. The new model of zkEVM is like this: we hire a \"chef\" (zero-knowledge proof generator). This chef is highly skilled and trustworthy. When someone wants a dish, the chef cooks it once and then provides a small \"certificate of authenticity\" (zero-knowledge proof). This certificate does not reveal how the dish was made, but it can mathematically prove that the dish was made perfectly according to the recipe without cutting any corners. Other people in the restaurant (validators) only need to quickly check this small certificate without having to re-cook the entire dish. This allows restaurants to process thousands of certificates quickly and cheaply. Why does Ethereum have to \"risk everything\"? There are three core drivers behind Ethereum's choice to fully embrace zero-knowledge proofs: First, it is a correction to the side effects of EIP-4844. Although EIP-4844 successfully reduced the cost of Layer 2, it accidentally weakened the revenue of Layer 1. It's like a large shopping mall that reduces parking fees to almost free in order to attract customers, only to find that its main source of income has disappeared. Ethereum found that its transaction fee income and ETH destruction have dropped significantly, affecting the entire economic model. Through the zkEVM upgrade, Ethereum L1 can handle more high-value transactions and rebalance the economic relationship between L1 and L2. Second, this is an asymmetric strategy to deal with high-performance competitors. Faced with a high-performance blockchain like Solana, Ethereum has chosen a unique path. Instead of sacrificing decentralization for performance like its competitors, it uses ZK technology to achieve a performance leap through \"cheap verification\" rather than \"expensive replay\" while maintaining a network of millions of validators. In the end, this is a forward-looking layout to meet the wave of institutional finance. When financial giants such as BlackRock and Franklin Templeton began to enter the blockchain field, they had extremely high requirements for security, finality, and compliance. The cryptographic level finality provided by zero-knowledge proofs and the ability to prove compliance without leaking sensitive data are the core needs of institutional finance. Technical standards: a nearly impossible task The Ethereum Foundation has set extremely strict technical standards for L1 zkEVM: Proof latency (99% percentile): less than 10 seconds Cryptographic security: 128 bits (minimum 100 bits at startup) Proof size: less than 300 KiB Prover hardware cost: no more than $100,000 Prover power consumption: less than 10 kilowatts These numbers may seem technical, but they represent a turning point: moving zero-knowledge proofs from the laboratory to practical use, from elite tools to generally available technology. Multi-proof security model: decentralized cryptographic verification The most innovative is the \"multi-proof security model\". Ethereum requires that the same block must generate multiple proofs by multiple zkEVMs from different teams (such as Scroll, Polygon, and Kakarot). The block is accepted only when multiple independent proofs are verified. This is like asking multiple independent auditors to audit the same financial report, and the report is only recognized when all auditors give a \"pass\" conclusion. This design provides deep defense for L1 through redundancy and diversity at the protocol level. Reshuffle of the Rollup Ecosystem This change will fundamentally change the competitive landscape of Layer 2. The Spring of ZK-Rollup The native Rollup function will allow ZK-Rollup to directly call the built-in verification logic of the L1 protocol without having to write complex verification contracts by itself. This is equivalent to Ethereum L1 providing a standardized, highly secure and efficient verification layer for all ZK-Rollups for free. Transformation of Optimistic Rollup In the face of this challenge, the leading Optimistic Rollup did not choose to confront, but actively adapted. Optimism is developing ZK fraud proof, and Arbitrum proposed the design of \"ZK+Optimistic hybrid proof\". When the ZK proof can be generated in time, the system provides instant confirmation; when it cannot be generated in time, it automatically falls back to the traditional optimistic proof mode. Opportunities and risks coexist Opportunities: Transaction costs are greatly reduced Transaction confirmation time is significantly shortened Ethereum may increase the Gas limit by 10 times or even 100 times Stronger security guarantees and instant finality Risks: Prover centralization: Generating ZK proofs requires specialized hardware, which may lead to the concentration of provers in the hands of a few entities Technical complexity: The complexity of ZK circuits makes auditing and verification difficult Proof generation delay: Although verification is fast, it may take time to generate proofs Economic sustainability: The cost-benefit model of provers needs to be carefully balanced Implementation plan for 2025 According to the latest news, the Ethereum Foundation plans to gradually launch zkEVM in 2025: 1. Initial stage: A small number of validators run ZK clients for testing 2. Scaling stage: As confidence builds and tools improve, the number of participating validators gradually increases 3. Maturity stage: When a super majority of zk validators are reached, Ethereum can start to increase the Gas limit Ethereum also launched the Ethproofs.org research platform, which is dedicated to accelerating the adoption of zero-knowledge proof technology. What does this mean? This change marks the evolution of Ethereum from a \"world computer\" to a \"verifiable world computer\". By deeply embedding cryptographic truths into its core, Ethereum is not only paving the way for its own future, but also building a more secure, trustworthy and scalable foundation for the entire decentralized world. For ordinary users, this means: Significantly reduced transaction fees when using DeFi and DApps Transaction confirmation time is close to the experience of traditional network applications Stronger security guarantees and privacy protection Ability to participate in more applications that were previously inaccessible due to high costs For developers, this means: Greater design space and innovation possibilities Lower user usage threshold More business model possibilities Conclusion: The era of cryptographic truth Ethereum's zkEVM upgrade is not only a technical upgrade, but also a paradigm shift. It represents our transformation from \"trusting code\" to \"trusting mathematics\", and the evolution from \"trust but verification\" to \"zero knowledge but certainty\". In this transformation process, Ethereum is proving an important point: the best technological innovation is not to abandon the old system, but to achieve the same goal with more advanced methods while maintaining its core values. When we talk about zkEVM, we are not only talking about technology, but also about a future of trust, security and openness. In this future, every calculation is backed by mathematics, every transaction is protected by cryptography, and every innovation is built on an unbreakable foundation. The finality of zero-knowledge proof is Ethereum's most firm commitment to this future.",
