  "title": "Can ordinary people also invest in SpaceX and OpenAI? The new era of private equity tokenization",
  "content": "Have you ever thought that one day you can also invest in star companies such as SpaceX or OpenAI? In the past, these unlisted high-growth company investment opportunities were only available to super-rich and large institutional investors. But now, blockchain technology is changing all that. In June 2025, Robinhood, a world-renowned brokerage, launched a revolutionary service in Europe: allowing ordinary investors to invest in private companies such as OpenAI and SpaceX through blockchain tokens. As soon as this news came out, it immediately caused a sensation in the financial community.  What is private equity tokenization?   Let's first understand what private equity is. Imagine that you invested in a promising technology company before it went public, such as Alibaba or Tencent in those days. This is private equity investment. Traditionally, this kind of investment requires a capital threshold of millions or even tens of millions, and ordinary people cannot participate at all. Tokenization is like dividing an expensive house into countless small shares, and everyone can buy a small piece. Through blockchain technology, we can \"break\" these private companies' investment opportunities into countless digital tokens, so that ordinary investors can also participate.  Technical principle: Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV)  So, these companies are obviously not listed, why can they be tokenized? The key lies in a financial instrument called \"Special Purpose Vehicle\" (SPV). Simply put, this SPV is like a middleman. It first uses investors' money to buy real shares of SpaceX or OpenAI, and then issues tokens to investors. The tokens held by investors represent their economic interests in this SPV, rather than directly holding shares in the company. It's like you and a group of friends partnered to buy a house, and then each person holds a certificate proving their share. Only now this certificate is digital and exists on the blockchain.  Why is this trend happening now?   There are three main reasons: First, technology companies delay listing. In the past, successful technology companies would go public after reaching a certain stage of development, giving public investors the opportunity to participate. But now, companies like SpaceX and OpenAI choose to stay private longer because the funds in the private market are sufficient to support their development. Second, investor demand is strong. Ordinary investors see the huge potential of these star companies, but suffer from the lack of investment channels. Market demand has driven the emergence of innovative solutions. Third, blockchain technology is mature. Blockchain provides a transparent, secure, and programmable platform that allows complex financial products to operate at a lower cost and higher efficiency.  Opportunities and risks coexist  For investors, this innovation has brought unprecedented opportunities. You can invest in the world's most promising technology companies with relatively small funds. This kind of portfolio diversification was only available to institutional investors in the past. But the risks are equally obvious. First, these tokens usually do not give you voting rights or direct corporate governance rights. You only have economic interests, not real shareholders. Second, the regulatory environment is still evolving, and regulatory changes may affect your investment. On top of that, the valuations of these private companies are often less transparent than those of publicly listed companies, and risk assessment is more difficult.  Companies have different attitudes  Interestingly, the tokenized companies have different attitudes towards this. OpenAI has publicly stated that the tokens issued by Robinham do not represent real OpenAI shares, and they have not authorized this practice. This highlights the complexity and controversy of this emerging field. For these companies, tokenization is both an opportunity and a challenge. On the one hand, it allows companies to reach a wider investor base and increase brand awareness. On the other hand, it may also bring regulatory and reputational risks.  Evolution of the regulatory environment  Currently, Europe's regulatory environment for tokenized assets is relatively loose, which is why Robinham chose to launch this service in Europe first. The US SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) takes a more cautious attitude and may classify these tokens as securities, thus applying stricter regulatory regulations. Looking ahead to the next 2-3 years, we may see: first, the regulatory framework gradually becomes clearer, second, traditional financial institutions are more involved, and third, secondary market transactions are more active. This trend will reshape the landscape of private equity investment.  Advice for Chinese readers  If you are interested in this field, here are a few points to note: 1. Fully understand the risks: This is a very new investment field and the risks are high. Only invest money you can afford to lose. 2. Research the legal structure: Understand what you are actually buying. Usually not direct equity, but economic interests. 3. Pay attention to regulatory changes: Regulations in different countries may affect your investment. 4. Consider liquidity: Despite the promise of better liquidity, the secondary market for these tokens is still limited.  Conclusion  Private equity tokenization represents the forefront of financial technology innovation. It has the potential to break down investment barriers and allow more people to participate in investing in high-growth companies. But at the same time, it also brings new risks and challenges. This trend is like the early Internet, full of possibilities, but also with a lot of uncertainty. For investors, it is important to keep an open mind, but it is more important to be cautious. After all, in the wave of financial innovation, only those who dare to try and are good at risk management can truly succeed. In any case, this change deserves our close attention. Because it is not only a change in investment methods, but also an important step in the digital transformation of the entire financial system.",
