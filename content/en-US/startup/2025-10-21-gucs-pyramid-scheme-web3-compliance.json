  "title": "When \"blockchain mining machines\" become part of a $1.7 billion fraud: How did a technical team unknowingly become accomplices?",
  "content": "  Have you ever considered that writing code for a Web3 project could land you in jail for 15 years? In 2023, the Chengdu court delivered its verdict in the \"GUCS Kylin Mining Machine\" case: the ringleader was sentenced to life imprisonment for fundraising fraud, core members were sentenced to 15 years in prison for organizing and leading pyramid schemes, and some technical personnel were held criminally liable for aiding and abetting cybercrime. The case involved a staggering 1.794 billion yuan, with 29,000 participants spread across 26 provinces and municipalities nationwide. What's shocking about this case isn't that yet another \"blockchain scam\" has been uncovered, but that it reveals a cruel reality: in the Web3 world, the concept of \"technology neutrality\" (meaning that technological tools themselves do not bear moral or legal responsibility, only the user's behavior bears responsibility) is almost non-existent in judicial practice. Attorney Shao Shiwei, specializing in cryptocurrency and Web3 legal compliance, pointed out a key issue in analyzing this case: \"After all, most legally operating entrepreneurs do not have the subjective intention to defraud, but their promotional methods or model design may inadvertently trigger pyramid scheme risks. Furthermore, if technical personnel fail to identify the compliance of the project itself, they may also face legal repercussions.\" This statement sounds mild, but it actually reveals a terrifying logic: even if you are just a programmer writing code, even if you don't know what the company is doing, as long as the system you wrote is used for pyramid schemes, you may face criminal charges. ## The True Face of the GUCS Case: Not Technological Innovation, but a Pyramid Scheme in Old Bottles Let's first examine how GUCS actually operated. The \"GUCS\" platform initially marketed itself with \"blockchain + mining machine rental,\" advertising itself as \"surpassing Ethereum,\" attracting numerous participants to invest funds. Entry requirements included paying a \"disciple fee\" or purchasing so-called \"Kirin mining machines,\" supplemented by a \"master-disciple\" system, creating a hierarchical organizational structure. Regarding the profit mechanism, the platform set fixed \"static income\" and encouraged participants to develop downlines through \"direct referral bonuses\" and \"team bonuses.\" As the model expanded, participation spread to 26 provinces and cities across the country, attracting a total of over 29,000 investors and involving funds amounting to 1.794 billion yuan. Until the platform announced the closure of its mainland operations due to \"policy reasons,\" the relevant funds were transferred overseas. If you remove the trendy terms like \"blockchain\" and \"mining machine,\" this business model is exactly the same as pyramid schemes from the 1990s: 1. **Entry Fee:** To join, you must first pay money or buy products. 2. **Hierarchical Relationship:** A hierarchical structure is established through \"mentorship\" or \"apprenticeship.\" 3. **Recruiting and Sharing Money:** Your income mainly comes from developing downlines, not from selling products. This is why the judicial authorities ultimately prosecuted you for multiple crimes, including fundraising fraud, organizing and leading pyramid schemes, concealing crimes, and aiding and abetting cybercrime. The law doesn't care whether you use \"blockchain\" or \"quantum technology,\" it only cares whether your business logic meets the elements of a pyramid scheme. ## The Legal Red Line of Pyramid Schemes: The Boundary Between Administrative Violation and Criminal Offense Many Web3 entrepreneurs have a misconception: they believe that as long as they don't intentionally deceive others, there won't be any legal problems. However, in the Chinese legal system, the definition of pyramid schemes is very clear, and it is divided into two levels. **Administrative Level**, according to the \"Regulations on Prohibiting Pyramid Schemes,\" if any of the following situations exist, it can be considered an illegal act: - Using the number of recruits as the basis for calculating remuneration - Using sales performance as the standard for rebates - Using the payment of fees as a condition for obtaining membership These situations are usually dealt with by fines and confiscation of illegal gains, which are considered \"administrative penalties.\" **From a criminal perspective**, Article 224-1 of the Criminal Law stipulates that if an act possesses the following characteristics: 1. Requiring participants to pay fees or purchase goods to obtain membership; 2. Forming a hierarchical relationship; 3. Using the number of recruits as the basis for remuneration; 4. The organization has more than 30 members and more than 3 levels, then it constitutes the crime of **organizing and leading a pyramid scheme** (Article 224-1 of the Criminal Law of China, punishable by up to 15 years imprisonment). The criminal risk is significantly increased, especially when the so-called products or services do not actually exist or their value is obviously inflated. The problem with the GUCS case is that it simultaneously met all of these conditions: - ✅ Required to pay \"apprentice fees\" or purchase \"mining machines\" to participate - ✅ Formed a multi-level network of \"mentorship\" - ✅ Rebates were directly linked to the number of people recruited - ✅ The scale reached 29,000 people, with levels far exceeding 3 - ✅ The so-called \"blockchain beyond Ethereum\" simply did not exist. This is why the court sentenced it so severely: this was not a gray area, but a clear criminal offense. ## Common Pitfalls in Web3 Projects: Well-Intentioned but Misguided \"Growth Hackers\" From an industry perspective, some Web3 projects do not subjectively intend to engage in pyramid schemes, but rather introduce designs with \"hierarchical\" or \"rebate\" features for user growth or market expansion. However, in legal evaluation, if these aspects are excessively amplified, they may trigger criminal risks. Let's look at some common risky designs: ### Risk 1: \"Referral Rewards\" Become \"Pyramid Schemes\" **Legitimate Practice**: Coinbase gives a $10 reward to both the referrer and the referred, which is a one-time reward, and both parties must complete a real transaction. **Illegal Practices**: GUCS' \"Direct Referral Bonus\" not only rewards the referrer but also continuously distributes revenue to the referrer based on the number of downlines the referred person makes, creating a multi-level marketing scheme. **What's the difference?** Legitimate referral bonuses are designed to reduce customer acquisition costs, essentially sharing advertising revenue with users. Illegal pyramid schemes make users' main source of income develop downlines, rather than using the product. ### Risk 2: \"Token Staking Returns\" Become \"Principal and Interest Guaranteed\" **Legitimate Practices**: Ethereum staking returns come from real network security contributions; the annualized rate of return fluctuates with the market and is not guaranteed. **Illegal Practices**: GUCS promises \"static returns,\" like a fixed return on a bank deposit. Legally, this is considered illegal fundraising (raising funds from the public without regulatory approval and promising to repay the principal and interest). **Why is this dangerous?** Because in the blockchain world, no one can guarantee a fixed return unless it's a Ponzi scheme—using newcomers' money to pay interest to older users. Once a fixed return is promised, the law assumes you are deceiving people. ### Risk 3: \"Community Governance\" Becomes a \"Hierarchical Organization\" **Legitimate Practices**: In Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), governance rights are derived from the number of governance tokens held, and everyone has equal voting rights. **Illegal Practices**: GUCS' \"mentorship\" system gives superiors actual control over subordinates, forming a pyramid-shaped power structure. **Key Difference**: The essence of DAOs is \"one coin, one vote\" democracy, while the essence of pyramid schemes is a hierarchical system of \"superiors controlling subordinates.\" The former is technological innovation, the latter is organized crime. ## History Repeats Itself: Global Warnings from OneCoin and BitConnect Many people believe that GUCS is just an isolated case in China, but in fact, it is a global trend. Let's see how other countries handle similar cases. ### OneCoin: The $4 Billion \"Crypto Queen\" Scam OneCoin began operating in 2014, claiming to be \"the next Bitcoin,\" attracting investors through a global multi-level marketing network, ultimately defrauding them of over $4 billion. **Key Figures Sentenced**: - **Karl Sebastian Greenwood** (Co-founder): Sentenced to 20 years in prison in 2023 for telecommunications fraud and money laundering. - **Irina Dilkinska** (Head of Legal and Compliance): Sentenced to 4 years in prison in 2023. - **Ruja Ignatova** (Founder, \"Crypto Queen\"): Has been on the run since 2017; the FBI has offered a $5 million reward for her capture. **Here's a shocking detail**: Irina Dilkinska was the company's Head of Legal and Compliance (a senior management position responsible for ensuring the company complies with laws and regulations), and her job was supposed to be ensuring the company's legal operation. But the court determined that she not only failed to prevent the crime but also assisted in money laundering, including arranging the transfer of $110 million in illicit proceeds to the Cayman Islands. What does this mean? **Even if your position is \"compliant,\" if you knowingly continue to provide professional services to a company that is committing crimes, you are an accomplice.** ### BitConnect: The $2.4 Billion Ponzi Scheme BitConnect founder Satish Kumbhani promoted a so-called \"lending scheme,\" claiming to generate high returns using trading bots, which was actually a classic Ponzi scheme—using new investors' money to pay interest to older investors. The U.S. Department of Justice stated in its indictment: \"BitConnect obtained approximately $2.4 billion from investors, but its so-called trading bots did not exist, and the profits came entirely from new investors' funds.\" **Similarities between BitConnect and GUCS**: 1. Both claimed to have revolutionary technology (trading bots vs. blockchain surpassing Ethereum) 2. Both promised fixed high returns (BitConnect's 40% monthly return vs. GUCS's static returns) 3. Both used multi-level referral rewards to encourage recruiting others 4. Both absconded before regulatory intervention, transferring funds overseas. This is not a coincidence, but rather the standard script of a Ponzi scheme (referring to the similar operating patterns and collapse paths followed by all Ponzi schemes). ## Fatal Misconceptions for Tech Teams: \"I'm just writing code\" is not an excuse for not being liable. Now let's talk about the most unsettling question for tech professionals: If you're just a programmer writing code according to the product manager's requirements, are you also at risk of legal consequences? The answer is: **Yes, and the risk is significant.** In the GUCS case, some tech professionals were prosecuted for the crime of \"Helping Information Network Criminal Activities\" (Article 287-2 of the Chinese Criminal Law, specifically targeting those who provide technical support for cybercrime). This crime was added in the 2015 Amendment (IX) to the Criminal Law, specifically to crack down on those who provide technical support for cybercrime. **The elements of the crime are very simple:** 1. Knowingly allowing others to commit crimes using the internet; 2. Providing them with technical support (e.g., developing systems, providing servers); 3. The circumstances are serious (e.g., illegal gains exceeding 10,000 yuan, or supporting more than 5 criminal websites). **The key question is:** What constitutes \"knowingly\"? When determining the crime, the judicial authorities do not require you to sign a statement admitting \"I know this is a crime.\" Instead, they infer it through objective evidence (verifiable facts not relying on the subjective confession of the parties involved): - Have your chat logs discussed \"this model is risky\"? - Does the requirement document given to you by the product manager contain obvious pyramid scheme characteristics such as \"multi-level marketing rebates\" and \"recruitment rewards\"? Does the core function of the system you developed calculate the number of downlines and tiered commissions? - Have you received any warnings from compliance or legal departments? If this evidence points to \"you should have known this is a pyramid scheme,\" then the law will determine that you \"knowingly\" knew, even if you never admitted it. ## Programmer's Self-Protection Guide: Leave Your \"Evidence of Innocence\" in the Code So, as a technologist, how should you protect yourself? Attorney Shao Shiwei offered several key suggestions, and I'll add some more concrete technical practices. ### 1. Document All Requirements and Questions **Don't just write code; keep written records.** - Whenever you receive a request involving \"referral rewards\" or \"tiered rebates,\" clarify the following in Jira or via email: - \"Is this reward a one-time offer or ongoing?\" - \"Does the reward come from company revenue or new user investments?\" - \"What is the maximum number of tiers? Do you have legal advice?\" These questions themselves are evidence that you have a compliance awareness, rather than writing code blindly. ### 2. Request Legal Advice **Request legal advice from the other party before accepting a project.** If it's an outsourced project, the contract should specify: \"Party B (the technical team) provides neutral technical services, and Party A (the project owner) guarantees the legality and compliance of the business model and provides a legal opinion.\" If the other party cannot provide a legal opinion, or if the opinion is casually issued by an unknown small law firm, this is itself a red flag warning. ### 3. Code Design Reflects \"Neutral Tool\" Characteristics **At the technical architecture level, try to maintain the universality of the tool.** For example, if you are making a referral system: - ❌ Do not write obvious pyramid scheme logic such as \"5-level rebate\" or \"the total number of downlines determines the rebate ratio\" - ✅ Design it as configurable parameters, allowing the business side to set them themselves. Your code is just a general framework. This makes it easier to prove legally that you are providing a general tool, not a system specifically designed for pyramid schemes. ### 4. Retain Evidence of Exit **If you discover any problems with the project, immediately raise them in writing and retain all evidence.** Email your boss: \"I've noticed the latest requirements involve multi-level marketing (MLM), which may violate the Prohibition on Pyramid Schemes Ordinance. I suggest suspending development and seeking legal advice.\" If they ignore this, consider leaving the company and keep this email. In case of future investigations, this will serve as evidence of your \"lack of knowledge\" or \"attempt to prevent\" the project. ### 5. Understanding \"Code Smells\"—Technical Characteristics of Multi-Level Marketing Systems Based on my research of multiple case studies, multi-level marketing systems exhibit significant \"code smells\" in their technical architecture: **Smell 1: The \"Recruitment Tree\" is More Core than \"Product Features\"** If in your database design, the most important fields in the User table are `parent_id`, `upline_id`, and `downline_count`, rather than `purchased_products` and `usage_history`, this is a red flag. In a legitimate business model, the data structure should revolve around products and services, not hierarchical relationships. **Issue 2: \"New User Deposits\" Directly Become \"Old User Revenue Sharing\"** If your smart contract or payment logic looks like this: ```javascript function register() payable { require(msg.value == 1 ether); // New users must pay payUpline(msg.sender, msg.value * 0.1); // Directly give 10% to upline payUplineOfUpline(msg.sender, msg.value * 0.05); // Give 5% to upline of upline } ```This is a Ponzi scheme—new users' money is directly distributed to old users, without any intermediary products or services. **The legal approach should be:** ```javascript function register() payable { require(msg.value == registrationFee); companyRevenuePool.transfer(msg.value); // Enter the company's revenue pool }function payReferralBonus(user) { // The bonus is paid from the company's revenue pool, not directly from the new user require(companyRevenuePool.balance > bonus); user.transfer(bonus); } ``` This design makes it easier to legally prove that the reward comes from the company's operating revenue, not the principal of the new investor. ## The Boundaries of Compliance: What Kind of Web3 Referral Mechanism is Safe? Many people ask: Can Web3 projects offer referral rewards? Can they distribute tokens? The answer is: Yes, but it must meet several principles. ### Principle 1: Revenue must come from real products or services. **Legal Example:** Uniswap's liquidity mining - Users provide liquidity (locking tokens in a pool) - Traders use the pool and pay transaction fees - Liquidity providers receive a share of the transaction fees. Revenue here comes from real trading services, not from new users' principal. **Illegal Example:** GUCS' \"Static Returns\" - Users purchase \"mining rigs\" - The platform promises fixed returns - Revenue actually comes from the money new users spend on purchasing mining rigs. There are no real products here; revenue comes from the circulation of funds. ### Principle 2: Referral rewards should be one-time, not a continuous tiered commission. **Legal Case:** Coinbase's referral program - Both the referrer and the referred person receive $10 - This is a one-time reward and will not continue to generate profits due to the referred person's continued use - The referred person's downline will not give any rewards to the first referrer. **Illegal Case:** GUCS' \"Direct Referral Bonus + Team Bonus\" - You get 10% when someone you refer invests - You get another 5% when someone you refer refers others to invest - This forms a multi-level continuous commission structure. This is a typical pyramid scheme structure. ### Principle 3: No \"entry fee\"; participation should be free. **Legal Case**: Ethereum staking - You can choose to stake 32 ETH to become a validator, but you can also choose not to stake and continue using Ethereum normally. Staking is not a condition for \"joining,\" but a requirement for \"providing services.\" **Illegal Case**: GUCS' \"apprenticeship fee\" - You must pay money or buy mining equipment to participate. Without paying, you cannot obtain any benefits. This is the legal \"entry fee.\" ## Global Regulatory Trends: Cryptocurrency is Not a Lawless Zone. The GUCS case is just a microcosm of the global regulatory trend. Let's look at the attitudes of different jurisdictions. ### United States: The SEC's \"Howey Test\" The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) uses the Howey Test (established by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1946, a four-factor test to determine whether a transaction constitutes a security investment) to determine whether a token is a security: 1. Investing capital; 2. Investment in a joint venture; 3. Expected profit; 4. Profit derived from the efforts of others. If all four conditions are met, the token is a security and must comply with securities laws. Most ICOs and token sales are considered illegal securities offerings by the SEC. ### EU: Comprehensive Regulation by MiCA The Markets in Crypto-Assets Regulation (MiCA), which will come into effect in 2024, requires: - All cryptocurrency service providers to be registered and licensed. - Stablecoin issuers to hold reserves. - Investment schemes promising fixed returns are prohibited. The core logic of MiCA is: cryptocurrencies are not above the law and must comply with the basic principles of financial regulation. ### Singapore: \"Product Authenticity\" Test The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) takes a more pragmatic approach: We don't care what technology you use, we only care if your product is genuine. If you claim to sell mining machines, those machines must actually mine, and the profits must come from mining, not from recruiting others. If you claim to be doing DeFi, you must provide genuine financial services; it can't just be a Ponzi scheme. This \"product authenticity\" test is very simple: if you stop adding new users today, can your project still continue to operate and generate profit? If not, it's a Ponzi scheme. ## Counterintuitive Insight: Why \"Decentralization\" Can't Absolve You of Liability? Many Web3 entrepreneurs have a misconception: as long as my project is decentralized and I don't control users' funds, I'm not responsible. This is a complete misunderstanding. Let's look at a real-world example: Alexey Pertsev, the developer of Tornado Cash (a privacy mixing protocol on Ethereum that allows users to transfer funds anonymously), was arrested by Dutch police in 2022 on charges of aiding and abetting money laundering. His defense logic was: \"Tornado Cash is a completely decentralized smart contract. I just wrote the code, deployed it to the blockchain, and then I had no control over it. How users use this tool is none of my business.\" Sounds reasonable, right? But the Dutch court didn't agree. The court's logic is this: if the tool you develop is primarily used for crime (over 90% of Tornado Cash transactions involve money laundering), and you knowingly continue to maintain and promote this tool, then you are an accomplice (someone who knowingly assists another in committing a crime and bears similar criminal responsibility as the principal offender). \"Decentralization\" is merely a technical architecture, not a legal exemption. Just as you can't say, \"The guns I built are for hunting; it's none of my business if others use them to kill,\" if your tool is designed primarily for criminal purposes, you will bear responsibility. ## Five Survival Rules for Web3 Entrepreneurs In summary, after this analysis, I would like to offer five specific survival rules for Web3 entrepreneurs: ### Rule 1: Ask yourself, \"Can I still profit when new users stop joining?\" This is the simplest yet most fatal test. If the answer is \"no,\" then your model is a Ponzi scheme, and no matter what technical concept you package it as, it won't work. A legitimate business model generates revenue from creating value for existing customers, not from the initial investment of new customers. ### Rule 2: The reward mechanism should be \"flat,\" not \"pyramid.\" One-time referral bonus: ✅ Safe. Continuous tiered rewards: ❌ Dangerous. If you really want to implement multi-tiered rewards, there can only be a maximum of two tiers, and the upper limit of the reward percentage for each tier must be clearly defined. Furthermore, the reward source must be the company's revenue pool, not new user investments. ### Rule 3: Never promise fixed returns. In the blockchain world, no one can guarantee returns. If you make such a promise, regulators will assume you are lying. The correct approach is to clearly explain the risks: \"Past returns are X%, but future returns may fluctuate, and principal may be lost.\" ### Rule 4: Protect yourself with legal advice. Find a professional Web3 lawyer (not a regular corporate lawyer) to conduct due diligence and obtain written legal advice. If the lawyer says \"this model is risky,\" either change the model or don't do it. Don't take chances and think, \"Everyone does it this way, so it should be fine.\" The lesson from GUCS is: what everyone is doing may also be illegal. ### Rule 5: The technical team should also understand legal knowledge. As a CTO or technical lead, you can't just write code; you also need to be able to identify legal risks. We recommend that all Web3 technology teams learn these three legal concepts: - What is pyramid selling (multi-level marketing + recruiting)? - What is illegal fundraising (promising returns + raising funds from the public)? - What is money laundering (concealing illicit sources of funds)? If your boss asks you to implement these three functions, be immediately wary. ## Conclusion: The Balance Between Innovation and Compliance The GUCS case serves as a wake-up call for the entire Web3 industry. Technological innovation is a good thing, but it cannot be used as an excuse to circumvent the law. Blockchain, smart contracts, and decentralization are all tools. Tools themselves have no moral attributes, but those who use them have legal responsibilities. For entrepreneurs, the real challenge is not how to scale up, but how to find a balance between growth and compliance. Rapid growth is tempting, but if built on illegal foundations, it will ultimately collapse overnight. For tech professionals, \"I'm just writing code\" is no longer an excuse. In this era, programmers also need legal awareness, the courage to question their bosses' demands, and responsibility for their careers. Finally, a word to all Web3 practitioners: **In this industry, the scarcest resource is not technical skill, but judgment—the ability to judge what is permissible and what is not.** The mastermind behind GUCS was sentenced to life imprisonment, core members to 15 years, and even tech professionals faced criminal charges. The price was too high. I hope everyone who reads this article can learn a lesson from this case: innovation is important, but upholding the legal bottom line is even more crucial. Because freedom is the prerequisite for you to continue to innovate.",
