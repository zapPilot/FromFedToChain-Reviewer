  "title": "When the government no longer hates cryptocurrency: How the \"big and beautiful\" bill redefines the rules of the game for digital assets",
  "content": "Have you ever wondered why a bill called \"Big and Beautiful\" would cause the world's richest people to threaten to form a New Deal party, while at the same time exciting the cryptocurrency community? On July 1, the U.S. Senate passed the Trump administration's \"One Big Beautiful Bill Act\" (OBBB) in a procedural vote by 51 votes to 49. This bill, which is over 1,000 pages long, is ostensibly about tax cuts and spending cuts, but what is hidden behind it is a major shift in U.S. economic policy and a critical moment for cryptocurrency to move from the margins to the mainstream. When Musk threatened to form a New Deal party Musk's reaction on Twitter was extremely fierce: \"If this crazy spending bill passes, the American New Deal party will be formed the next day.\" His anger is not without reason. To understand this reaction, we need to go back to a basic contradiction in American politics: the Republican Party has long touted fiscal conservatism, but whenever it is in power, it actually significantly increases government spending. This \"big and beautiful\" bill once again exposed this contradiction. Imagine if your friend always said he was going on a diet, but ordered the most dishes every time you had a meal together, what would you think? Musk's anger comes from this frustration of \"inconsistency between words and deeds.\" What he sees is not two parties, but \"one party pretending to be two parties\" - both are keen on government spending, but the direction of spending money is different. This reaction reveals the deep changes in American politics: traditional party boundaries are blurring, and new political alliances are forming. Musk does not represent traditional conservatives, but a kind of \"technological liberalism\" - supporting innovation, but opposing excessive government intervention. The $300 Revolution But let’s turn our attention to the most interesting part of the bill: the cryptocurrency tax amendment proposed by Wyoming Senator Cynthia Lummis. The amendment seems simple: exempt cryptocurrency transactions under $300 from tax, with an annual cap of $5,000. But this seemingly minor change could trigger an avalanche of cryptocurrency adoption. Why? Let’s use an example to illustrate. Let’s say you want to buy a cup of coffee with cryptocurrency. Under existing tax law, you need to calculate capital gains taxes even if you only use 0.01 Bitcoin to buy a $5 cup of coffee. If your Bitcoin cost you $4, you will need to pay tax on the $1 “gain.” This process is not only complicated, but also completely irrational. No one calculates capital gains tax for buying a cup of coffee, just as no one calculates exchange rate gains for buying something with foreign currency. The $300 tax-free amount accurately covers most daily payment scenarios. It tells the market that the government recognizes cryptocurrency as a payment tool, not just a speculative asset. The dual coordination of fiscal policy and monetary policy is even more interesting. The timing of the passage of this bill is even more interesting. At the same time as the bill passed the procedural vote, Goldman Sachs brought forward its forecast for the Fed's interest rate cut from December to September. This is not a coincidence. The market has already smelled the smell of policy coordination. Traditional economics holds that fiscal policy (government spending and taxes) and monetary policy (interest rates and money supply) should be independent of each other. But in reality, when the government decides to cut taxes and increase spending on a large scale, the central bank often needs to cooperate by cutting interest rates to avoid overheating of the economy or turmoil in financial markets. Imagine that the government decides to give money to every household (fiscal expansion), but at the same time the central bank decides to raise interest rates (monetary tightening). It's like a person stepping on the accelerator and the brake at the same time, and the effects will offset each other. Goldman Sachs' forecast adjustment shows that the market believes that the Fed will cooperate with the government's fiscal expansion policy to provide necessary liquidity support. This coordination happened during the COVID-19 epidemic and may happen again now. Why now? Why cryptocurrency? The timing choice reveals the deep considerations of policymakers. First, the global economy is facing the risk of slowing growth. The European economy is weak and the Chinese economy is also facing challenges. In this case, the United States needs to maintain economic growth through the coordination of fiscal and monetary policies. Second, cryptocurrency has become an economic force that cannot be ignored. The global cryptocurrency market value exceeds 2 trillion US dollars, and the United States has the largest cryptocurrency market in the world. Ignoring this market is tantamount to giving up an important economic growth engine. Third, the pressure of international competition. The EU is about to implement the MiCA regulation to provide a clear legal framework for cryptocurrency. Countries such as Japan and Singapore are also actively formulating cryptocurrency-friendly policies. If the United States does not keep up, it may lose its competitive advantage in the digital economy era. Impact at three levels This policy change will have an impact at three levels: Personal level: Ordinary users no longer need to calculate complex taxes for small cryptocurrency transactions. This lowers the threshold for use and may promote the transformation of cryptocurrency from an investment tool to a payment tool. Corporate level: Companies can more easily accept cryptocurrency payments without having to worry about complex tax processing. This may drive more merchants to accept cryptocurrency, forming a positive cycle. System level: The U.S. financial system has begun to formally recognize the legal status of cryptocurrency. This will not only affect the United States, but also the policy choices of other countries around the world. Potential risks and challenges Of course, any policy change has potential risks. The first is the technical challenge of implementation. How to define \"transaction\"? How to prevent large transactions from being artificially split into small transactions? How to ensure that tax software and trading platforms implement these rules correctly? All of these require detailed technical specifications. The second is the risk of regulatory arbitrage. If cryptocurrency transactions enjoy tax benefits while traditional financial transactions do not, it may lead to a large amount of funds flowing into the cryptocurrency market, affecting the stability of the traditional financial system. The third is the challenge of international coordination. If the United States adopts a cryptocurrency-friendly policy while other countries adopt strict regulation, it may lead to regulatory arbitrage and distortion of capital flows. A turning point in history We are witnessing a turning point in history. Over the past decade, the relationship between cryptocurrency and the traditional financial system has been in a state of confrontation. Governments and regulators see cryptocurrency as a threat and try to restrict its development. The cryptocurrency community, on the other hand, sees the government as an obstacle to innovation and advocates \"decentralization\" and \"unregulated\". But the cryptocurrency provisions of the \"Big and Beautiful\" bill represent a new way of thinking: rather than confronting it, it is better to integrate it. The government has begun to realize that cryptocurrency is not a substitute for traditional finance, but a complement and upgrade to traditional finance. This transformation is like the development process of the Internet. In the early 1990s, the Internet was seen as a threat to traditional communications and media. But in the end, the Internet did not replace traditional industries, but transformed and upgraded them. Implications for investors For investors, this policy change releases several important signals: 1. Reduced policy risks: Regulatory uncertainty around cryptocurrencies is decreasing, which will reduce investment risks and may drive more institutional funds to enter. 2. Expanded usage scenarios: Tax incentives will promote the use of cryptocurrencies in daily payments and expand their actual application scenarios. 3. Market maturity: The government’s formal recognition marks that the cryptocurrency market is moving from speculation to maturity. 4. Intensified competition: As regulations become clearer, more traditional financial institutions will enter the cryptocurrency market and competition will become more intense. Conclusion: The victory of pragmatism The cryptocurrency clause of the \"Big and Beautiful\" bill is essentially a victory of pragmatism over ideology. Whether we support or oppose cryptocurrency, we must recognize one reality: cryptocurrency has become part of the economic system. Instead of trying to stop this trend, we should learn how to coexist with it and benefit from it. Musk's anger reflects the disintegration of the old political paradigm, but the passage of the cryptocurrency clause heralds the formation of a new paradigm. In this new paradigm, technological innovation and policy making are no longer a zero-sum game, but a win-win relationship. A $300 tax exemption may seem insignificant, but it could trigger an avalanche of cryptocurrency adoption. Because real revolutions often start not with big events, but with small details. The next time you buy coffee with cryptocurrency, remember: you are not just spending, you are participating in a historic experiment that redefines the meaning of money. And the \"big and beautiful\" bill may be the key to the success of this experiment.",
